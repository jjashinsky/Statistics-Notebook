There are two types of day-care centers in Israel: private and public. A study was conducted in 10 private day-care centers in the city of Haifa from January to June 1998. All of these centers are located in the same part of town, and there is no important difference among them. During the day children are organized into groups according to age, from 1 to 4 years old. Each day-care center is allowed to hold a maximum of 35 children. In some exceptional cases a few additional children are allowed. The fee for each child is NIS 1,400 per month. (The NIS is the New Israeli Shekel.) At the time of the study, a U.S. dollar was worth approximately NIS 3.68, so the fee was about $380 at that time. 

The contract signed at the beginning of the year states that the day-care
center operates between 0730 and 1600. There is no mention of what happens if parents come late to pick up their children. In particular, before the beginning of the study, there was no fine for coming late. When parents did not come on time, one of the teachers had to wait with the children concerned. Teachers would rotate in this task, which is considered part of the job of a teacher, a fact that is clearly explained when a teacher is hired. Parents rarely came after 1630. 

A natural option [to fix the problem of parents showing up late] is to introduce a fine: every time a parent comes late, [they] will have to pay a fine. Will that reduce the number of parents who come late? If the fine is removed, will things revert back to the way they were originally?

The overall period of the study was 20 weeks. In the first 4 weeks we
simply recorded the number of parents who arrived late each week. At the
beginning of the fifth week, we introduced a fine in six of the 10 day-care centers, which had been selected randomly. The announcement of the fine was made with a note posted on the bulletin board of the day-care center. Parents tend to look at this board every day, since important announcements are posted there. The announcement specified that the fine would be NIS 10 for a delay of 10 minutes or more. The fine was per child; thus, if parents had two children in the center and they came late, they had to pay NIS 20. Payment was made to the principal of the day-care center at the end of the month. Since monthly payments are made to the owner during the year, the fines were added to those amounts. The money was paid to the owner, rather then to the teacher who was staying late (and did not get any additional money). The teachers were informed of the fine but not of the study. Registering the names of parents who came late was a common practice in any case.

At the beginning of the seventeenth week, the fine was removed with no explanation. Notice of the cancellation was posted on the board. If parents asked why the fines were removed, the principals were instructed to reply that the fine had been a trial for a limited time and that the results of this trial were now being evaluated.

A comparison with other fines in Israel may give an idea of the size of
the penalty that was introduced. A fine of NIS 10 is relatively small but not insignificant. In comparison, the fine for illegal parking is NIS 75; the fine for driving through a red light is NIS 1,000 plus penalties; the fine for not collecting the droppings of a dog is NIS 360. For many of these violations, however, detection and enforcement are low or, as in the case of dog dirt, nonexistent in practice. A baby-sitter earns between NIS 15 and NIS 20 per hour. The average gross salary per month in Israel at the time of the study was NIS 5,595.

An Analysis of Variance will be performed to see whether there is a difference in means of the number of late children between the periods of No fine (labeled as control), Fine, and Post Fine. The groups that never received a fine throughout the study were not considered in this analysis. 

#### Hypothesis 

Let $\mu_C$ = mean of Control, $\mu_F$ = mean of Fine, and $\mu_P$ = mean of Post Fine. Then our formal hypotheses will be written as thus 

$$
H_0: \mu_C = \mu_F = \mu_P = \mu
$$
$$
H_a: \mu_i \neq \mu \ \text{for at least one} \ i \ \epsilon \ \text{{C,F,P}}
$$
Our level significance will be $\alpha = 0.05$


#### Analysis

Below is a box plot of the number of parents or guardians who picked up their child late. We can see that there is a visible difference between the three.

```{r}
boxplot(No.ofLateChildren ~ Period, data = Late, col = c("steelblue1", "blue2", "royalblue4"), main = "Late Parents in Each Period", ylab = "Number of Late Parents")
```

A summary of the statistics from these three groups are shown in the table below. 

```{r}
pander(favstats(No.ofLateChildren ~ Period, data=Late))
```

We can see that the summaries of the groups Fine and Post Fine are very similar, and the Control is lower in almost every statistic. To determine if the results are significant an analysis of variance was conducted.


```{r}
myaov <- aov(No.ofLateChildren ~ as.factor(Period), data=Late)
pander(summary(myaov))
```

The test resulted in a large F score which produces a p-value of .0001436. Comparing this to the alpha we see that $\alpha = 0.05 > .0001436$. Therefore sufficient evidence leads us to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that one of the meanings is different from mu. 

To see whether an analysis of variance was appropriate in this setting these three assumptions must be satisfied. 

* The samples of data properly represent their population.

* The population variance of each group is assumed to be the same.

* The data is normally distributed in each group, meaning that the residuals from the ANOVA are normally distributed. 



```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(myaov, which=1:2, pch=16)
```

It is assumed that the samples taken represent the population being studied. The Residual vs Fitted graphs shows that there is a slight difference in variances. Also, the Normal Q-Q plot shows that residuals are bit skewed, but for our purposes we will consider them as normally distributed.  

The difference in means can be seen in the box plot. It shows that the control is the mean that differs from the rest. 


#### Interpretation

The test results shows that the control had less children waiting for their parents or guardians, than the other two periods. The results are surprising and the exact opposite of what was hoped for. The fines were put in place to encourage punctuality with parents and guardians.   

It is important to note that the results of this study can be questioned based on the fact that the variances could not be assumed to be equal, and normality could also be brought into question. While all of the assumptions of an ANOVA were not met, they were close.  

To further investigate the case we can observe that even after the fines were retracted children were still waiting to be picked up. Therefore it would be useful to continue observations within the control and experimental groups to see whether the mean of the post fine period will revert back to the same value as the mean of the control or if it will remain as it is. 

The results of this study suggest that day care centers should seek other procedures or regulations to decrease the the amount of late parents.
